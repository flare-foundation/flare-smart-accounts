# Redeem flow

The composer's only state-changing entry point from the outside world is `lzCompose`. This document walks through what happens between "a compose message arrives" and "fAsset has been redeemed (or refunded)".

## Inputs

```solidity
function lzCompose(
    address _from,
    bytes32 _guid,
    bytes calldata _message,
    address /* _executor */,
    bytes calldata /* _extraData */
) external payable nonReentrant;
```

The trailing two arguments are ignored — the composer reads its own executor preference from the decoded message body. `nonReentrant` uses `ReentrancyGuardTransient` (EIP-1153 transient storage).

The `_message` is a LayerZero OFT compose envelope:
- `srcEid` (4 bytes) — source endpoint ID.
- `amountLD` (32 bytes) — local-decimal amount that arrived on Flare.
- The composer message body (variable) — ABI-encoded `RedeemComposeMessage`.

Decoding uses `OFTComposeMsgCodec.srcEid`, `OFTComposeMsgCodec.amountLD`, and `OFTComposeMsgCodec.composeMsg` from `@layerzerolabs/oft-evm`.

`RedeemComposeMessage`:

```solidity
struct RedeemComposeMessage {
    address redeemer;                       // EVM owner of the per-redeemer account
    string redeemerUnderlyingAddress;       // destination on the FAsset underlying chain
    bool redeemWithTag;                     // true → call redeemWithTag (XRP only)
    uint256 destinationTag;                 // tag value; only used if redeemWithTag
    address payable executor;               // if zero, use defaultExecutor
    uint256 executorFee;                    // wei expected from msg.value
}
```

## Step-by-step

### 1. Authorization

```solidity
require(msg.sender == endpoint, OnlyEndpoint());
require(_from == trustedSourceOApp, InvalidSourceOApp(_from));
```

Only the trusted Flare-side LayerZero endpoint can call. Only the trusted source-chain OFT adapter can be the message's logical source.

### 2. Decode

```solidity
uint32 srcEid = OFTComposeMsgCodec.srcEid(_message);
uint256 amountLD = OFTComposeMsgCodec.amountLD(_message);
RedeemComposeMessage memory redeemComposeMessage = abi.decode(
    OFTComposeMsgCodec.composeMsg(_message),
    (RedeemComposeMessage)
);
require(redeemComposeMessage.redeemer != address(0), InvalidAddress());
require(msg.value >= redeemComposeMessage.executorFee, InsufficientExecutorFee(msg.value, executorFee));
```

The composer enforces `msg.value >= executorFee`. The matching expectation on the source side is that the `lzComposeOption` is configured with a compose value of at least `executorFee` so the LayerZero executor is incentivized to deliver `lzCompose` with the right native value. The integration note on [`IFAssetRedeemComposer`](../../../contracts/userInterfaces/IFAssetRedeemComposer.sol) calls this out.

### 3. Composer fee

```solidity
uint256 composerFee = mulDiv(amountLD, _getComposerFeePPM(srcEid), 1_000_000);
uint256 amountToRedeemAfterFee = amountLD - composerFee;
if (composerFee > 0) {
    fAsset.safeTransfer(composerFeeRecipient, composerFee);
    emit ComposerFeeCollected(_guid, srcEid, composerFeeRecipient, composerFee);
}
```

`_getComposerFeePPM(srcEid)` returns the per-srcEid override (if set) or the default. See [Fees](./Fees.md).

### 4. Forward fAsset to the redeemer account

```solidity
address redeemerAccount = _getOrCreateRedeemerAccount(redeemComposeMessage.redeemer);
fAsset.safeTransfer(redeemerAccount, amountToRedeemAfterFee);
emit FAssetTransferred(redeemerAccount, amountToRedeemAfterFee);
```

`_getOrCreateRedeemerAccount` returns the existing account if one is registered, otherwise CREATE2-deploys a new `FAssetRedeemerAccountProxy` and primes its allowances via `setMaxAllowances(fAsset, stableCoin, wNat)` so the redeemer (the user's EVM address) can sweep the account if redemption later fails. See [Redeemer accounts](./RedeemerAccounts.md).

### 5. Select executor

```solidity
address payable executor = redeemComposeMessage.executor != address(0)
    ? redeemComposeMessage.executor
    : defaultExecutor;
```

The composer never falls back to `msg.sender` — `msg.sender` is always the LayerZero endpoint, not a user-facing identity.

### 6. Try redeem

```solidity
try IIFAssetRedeemerAccount(redeemerAccount).redeemFAsset{value: executorFee}(
    assetManager,
    amountToRedeemAfterFee,
    redeemerUnderlyingAddress,
    redeemWithTag,
    destinationTag,
    executor
) returns (uint256 redeemedAmountUBA) {
    // success path
} catch {
    // failure path
}
```

Inside the redeemer account:
- If `redeemWithTag`: assert `assetManager.redeemWithTagSupported()` (XRP only), then `assetManager.redeemWithTag{value: msg.value}(amount, underlying, executor, destinationTag)`.
- Else: `assetManager.redeemAmount{value: msg.value}(amount, underlying, executor)`.

Either path returns the redeemed UBA amount reported by the asset manager.

### 7a. Success: wrap any excess native

```solidity
uint256 excessAmount = 0;
if (msg.value > executorFee) {
    excessAmount = msg.value - executorFee;
    IWNat(address(wNat)).depositTo{value: excessAmount}(redeemerAccount);
}

emit FAssetRedeemed(
    guid, srcEid, redeemer, redeemerAccount,
    amountToRedeemAfterFee, redeemerUnderlyingAddress,
    redeemWithTag, destinationTag,
    executor, executorFee, redeemedAmountUBA, excessAmount
);
```

`executorFee` was forwarded as `msg.value` into `redeemFAsset`. Any native FLR the LayerZero executor over-delivered is wrapped to wNat and parked in the redeemer account — it isn't refunded to `tx.origin` and it isn't burned.

### 7b. Failure: wrap the whole `msg.value`

```solidity
if (msg.value > 0) {
    IWNat(address(wNat)).depositTo{value: msg.value}(redeemerAccount);
}

emit FAssetRedeemFailed(
    guid, srcEid, redeemer, redeemerAccount,
    amountToRedeemAfterFee, msg.value
);
```

The fAsset transfer in step 4 has already happened. So even on failure, the user's fAsset is in their redeemer account (allowance already set to `type(uint256).max` to the user's EVM address — they can transfer it out themselves). The native value gets wrapped into wNat the same way.

The failure path is wide on purpose — any revert from the asset manager (insufficient backing, unsupported tag, agent fault) lands here. The whole `lzCompose` call still **succeeds at the LayerZero level**, because if it reverted the message would be retried indefinitely and the composer doesn't want that.

## What replay protection looks like

The composer maintains **no replay set**. LayerZero guarantees `lzCompose(guid)` is delivered to the destination at most once per `guid` — the endpoint enforces that on its own state. The `_guid` parameter exists only for event correlation; the composer never reads it for replay decisions.

If a compose call reverts at the *composer* level (e.g., `OnlyEndpoint`, `InvalidSourceOApp`, `InvalidAddress`, `InsufficientExecutorFee`), the LayerZero endpoint can re-deliver it later — that's deliberate. The composer's revert checks are conditions on the message itself, not on protocol state, so they don't change between retries.

## Idempotent address derivation

After a redeemer's first `lzCompose`, `redeemerToRedeemerAccount[redeemer]` is set. Subsequent calls re-use the same account address. Off-chain code can predict the address before any redemption with `getRedeemerAccountAddress(redeemer)` — the function returns the stored address if known, otherwise the CREATE2 prediction.

## Recovery user actions

The redeemer account has two `onlyOwner`-gated recovery surfaces. They apply to different scenarios.

### After `FAssetRedeemFailed` — sweep residuals

When `redeemFAsset` reverts, the AssetManager's `redeemAmount` / `redeemWithTag` reverted with it, so **no redemption request was created**. There is no `redemptionRequestId` to default on. The composer has, however, already transferred the post-fee fAsset to the redeemer account (step 4) and wrapped all of `msg.value` to wNat in the redeemer account (step 7b). Both transfers stay put — they aren't unwound because the `try/catch` swallows the revert at the composer level.

The `setMaxAllowances` call performed at account creation set `forceApprove(owner, type(uint256).max)` on fAsset, stableCoin, and wNat. So the user recovers funds with a single `transferFrom(redeemerAccount, theirAddress, amount)` on whichever token they care about — no composer interaction needed.

### After `FAssetRedeemed` — redemption payment default

This applies to the **success** path: the redemption request was created, but the agent never made the corresponding underlying-chain payment within the allowed window. The user submits a non-payment proof to the AssetManager via the redeemer account:

- `FAssetRedeemerAccount.redemptionPaymentDefault(proof, requestId)` — generic variant.
- `FAssetRedeemerAccount.xrpRedemptionPaymentDefault(proof, requestId)` — XRP-specific variant.

Both are `onlyOwner` (the user's EVM redeemer address). The asset manager handles the actual payment-default accounting and returns the collateral payout into the redeemer account, from where the user sweeps it via the same pre-approved allowance.
