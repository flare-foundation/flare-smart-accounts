# Flare Smart Accounts (FSA)

The Flare Smart Accounts is an account abstraction that allows XRPL users to perform actions on the Flare chain without owning any FLR token. Each XRPL address is assigned a unique smart account on the Flare chain, which only it can control. They do so through Payment transactions on the XRPL. The Flare Smart Accounts are especially useful as a way of interacting with the FAssets workflow.
